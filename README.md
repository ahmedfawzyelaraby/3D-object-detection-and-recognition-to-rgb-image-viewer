# 3D Object Detection and Recognition to RGB Image Viewer ROS Node
This is a ROS based c++ code, whose role is to read the RGB images from the kinect and the detections message published  from the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks). It displays the RGB images, draw bounding boxes arroung each detected object and types the class of the object and its depth inside that box. This code was part of the work submited by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedfawzyelaraby/) in my [master's degree](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335127899_3D_Object_Detection_and_Classification_Using_Microsoft_Kinect_and_Deep_Neural_Networks).
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. **Please be noted that this code is tested on Ubuntu OS only**.
### Installation
This node is used by the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks), so all you have to do is follow the installation instructions in the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks).
### Deployment
This node is launched from within the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks).
