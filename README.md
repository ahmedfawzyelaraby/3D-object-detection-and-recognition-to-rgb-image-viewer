# 3D Object Detection and Recognition to RGB Image Viewer ROS Node
This is a ROS based c++ code, whose role is to read the RGB images from the kinect and the detections message published  from the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks). It displays the RGB images, draw bounding boxes arroung each detected object and types the class of the object and its depth inside that box.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. **Please be noted that this code is tested on Ubuntu OS only**.
### Installation
This node is used by the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks), so all you have to do is follow the installation instructions in the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks).
### Deployment
This node is launched from within the [3D Object Detection and Recognition Node](https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/3D-object-detection-and-recognition-with-microsoft-kinect-and-deep-neural-networks).
